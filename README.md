- Objective: Developed a KLLL Hostel Management System to streamline room booking and management processes for hostel admins and students.
- Scope:
  - Automated functionalities for admins to manage room bookings, modify room details, and search for bookings by student ID.
  - Enabled students to view, add, sort, modify, and delete room bookings through a user-friendly interface.
- Technical Details:
  - Data Structures:
    - Utilized C++ programming language to implement various data structures including linked lists, stacks, and queues.
    - Employed bubble sort for sorting room prices in ascending and descending order.
    - Implemented stack operations (push, pop) for managing room details and queue operations for handling student bookings.
  - Algorithms:
    - Sequential searching to find specific room bookings and room details.
    - Dynamic stack and queue sizes leveraging linked list implementations to avoid predefined size limitations.
  - Implementation:
    - Developed a user interface that offers distinct functionalities for admins and students.
    - Admin functionalities included searching bookings, viewing and modifying room details, and displaying student bookings.
    - Student functionalities covered viewing available rooms, booking rooms, and managing their bookings.
- Outcome:
  - Successfully created a dynamic and efficient system for hostel management, reducing manual processes and improving accessibility for both admins and students.
  - The system demonstrated practical applications of data structures and algorithms, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.
